## Explanation
### What is a Packet Sniffer?
A Packet Sniffer is a program that intercept the network traffic passing through
network interfaces (such as a network board).

Packet Sniffers are pretty useful specially for network analyzing and monitoring,
and they are often used by network administrators and security specialists.

### Can I use it for commercial purposes?
Actually, yeah, you can! However, this is a very simple packet sniffer, so there
might be better options for a commercial/professional usage. Two
of the most famous packet sniffers are [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) and
[tcpdump](https://www.tcpdump.org/).

### Can I use it for learning purposes?
Please, be my guest! That's the purpose of the tool: spread knowledge around. ðŸš€
You can use it to understand better network communication, or even to understand
better how packet sniffers are built. For the latter, I made sure to provide a
fully commented code.
