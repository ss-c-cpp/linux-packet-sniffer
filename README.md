## What is a Packet Sniffer?
A Packet Sniffer is a program that intercepts the network traffic passing through
network interfaces (such as a network board), logging every byte passed through the network.

Packet Sniffers are pretty useful specially for network analyzing and monitoring,
and they are often used by network administrators and security specialists.

The most famous Packet Sniffers on the market are [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) and
[tcpdump](https://www.tcpdump.org/).

## Is this Packet Sniffer good enough to be used professionally?
Unfortunatelly, not. ðŸ˜ž

I created it only for learning purposes. I had the opportunity to learn a bit more about networks and their protocols, so I thought that creating a Packet Sniffer would be a great opportunity to improve both my programming and networks knowledge.

Luckily I was right. It indeed improved both. ðŸŒŸ

## Can I use it for learning purposes?
Please, be my guest! ðŸš€

This is the main purpose of this project: help students to build their own.

I spent some hours trying to make the code clean and easily understandable by anyone else, but this is actually way harder than it seems to be.

If you feel the code quality could be improved in order to make it more friendly to new users, feel free to create a Pull Request.

Plus, if you feel comfortable to implement a fresh new feature here, you are also welcome. It might be a great opportunity to start contributing to an(other?) Open Source project. ðŸ’Ž
